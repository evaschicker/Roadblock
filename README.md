These files are an experiment. The animation was done in AfterEffects, then exported via Bodymovin as a .JSON file. I then downloaded the lottie player via bodymovin, lottie.js. The AeScript home page gave me the index.html & json scripts code to write (which is uploaded here) to view the entire animation as a responsive animation in the browser window.
